# How To Run

1. Set up your PostgreSQL environment
Ensure you have access to a PostgreSQL database (locally or cloud-hosted) and have loaded the relevant Parch & Posey dataset.

2. Connect to your SQL environment
Use a SQL client like:
    - pgAdmin
    - DBeaver
    - TablePlus
    - psql CLI

3. Run the .sql scripts

   Open each .sql file in your SQL client and execute the queries individually or in batches, depending on your analysis step.
